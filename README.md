🛡️ AegisAI — Predictive Cyber Defense System

AegisAI is an AI-powered cybersecurity platform that predicts attacks before they happen, automatically blocks malicious IPs, camouflages network traffic using DataCloak, and detects phishing attempts with PhishNet.

Key Features:-

(a) Predict Attacks

Uses time-series network analysis to predict cyber attacks 30–60 seconds in advance.

(b) Auto-Block

Automatically blocks suspicious IPs and isolates risky connections.

(c) DataCloak

Disguises outgoing traffic by altering packet sizes and timing to prevent fingerprinting.

(d) PhishNet

Detects phishing emails and provides a human-readable explanation.
